    Twinkle twinkle little star,
    How i wonder what you are,
    Up above the world so high,
    Like a diamond in the sky.
      
    When the blazing sun is gone,
    When the nothing shines upon,
    Then you show your little light,
    Twinkle, Twinlke all the night.
      
    Then the travewller in the dark, 
    Thanks tou for your tiny sparks,
    He could not see which way to go,
    If you did not twinkle so.
